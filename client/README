Very Basic Code Overview
------------------------

The main application is controlled through the CascaderFrame (cascaderview.py)
which backs onto the CascaderModel (cascadermodel.py)

The cascader model holds most of the non gui data and communicates with the 
view using callbacks registed in the view.

The model deals with the server through two classes, the RpcClient (client.py) 
which provides the functionality for client -> server and RpcService (service.py)
that provides functionality for server -> client


The program is single instance unless debug mode is used. It communicates to 
check for other instances of the program using dbus (cascadeapp, dbusutil.py)
