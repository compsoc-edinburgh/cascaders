# CompSoc Edinburgh Cascaders software.

This software is no longer in use, and the current committee is unlikely to know how it works.

Please [make an issue](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/cascaders/issues/new) or contact the [lead contributors](https://github.com/compsoc-edinburgh/cascaders/graphs/contributors?from=2011-08-14&to=2011-10-29&type=c) for more information about this project.

If you would like to get in touch with the current committee, they can be contacted at `committee@comp-soc.com`.
